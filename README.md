# Financial Loan Data Analysis

## Introduction
  
This project goes through my processing for analyzing a 2.2 million row Dataset of approved financial loans.  The Dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club).

## The Data
The Dataset comes from LendingClub, a company that provides loans to consumers and businesses.  There is only consumer loan data in this Dataset, and it comes with all sorts of characteristics like FICO scores, annual income, employment history, loan amount, and interest rate.


Fico scores from 600 - 850 only

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The only meaningful insight to derive from employment history is that LendingClub isn't willing to take as much risk with consumers unwilling to provide details on their employment history.  You can see the average loan amount is considerably lower for these candidates relative to all the others.
